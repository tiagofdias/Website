  <!-- Introduction Section -->
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    In today’s fast-paced development environment, version control systems play a critical role in tracking changes and coordinating collaborative work. Git, renowned for its speed and flexibility, enables developers to manage code efficiently. This paper examines key Git commands, exploring their functions and significance in streamlining project workflows.

  <!-- Core Concepts Section -->
  <h2>Core Concepts of Git</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    At its core, Git is designed to track changes in files, support non-linear development through branches, and maintain a detailed history of modifications. Understanding repositories, commits, branches, and merges is fundamental to mastering Git.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  
  <!-- Essential Git Commands Section -->
  <h2>Essential Git Commands</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    The following commands are among the most useful for effective Git workflow:
  </p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>git init:</strong> Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>git clone:</strong> Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>git status:</strong> Displays the status of the working directory and staging area.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>git add:</strong> Stages changes in the working directory for the next commit.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>git commit:</strong> Records a snapshot of the staged changes, including a commit message.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>git push:</strong> Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>git pull:</strong> Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>git branch:</strong> Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>git checkout:</strong> Switches between branches or restores working tree files.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>git merge:</strong> Merges changes from one branch into another.
    </li>
  </ul>
